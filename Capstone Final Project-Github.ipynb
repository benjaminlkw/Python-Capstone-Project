    "The purpose of this study is to find the most optimal location to open a new fitness centre that can satisfy our stakeholder's objectives. The objectives that influence the final decision are the number of fitness centres around (competition) and number of restaurants nearby. Number of restaurant nearby is a consideration because it is of our view that having restaurants nearby complement fitness centres as people who exercise tend to like these locations.\n",

Next, we have also used unsupervised machine learning K-means algorithm to cluster similar neighborhoods. Out of the 5 clusters produced by K-means, we have selected clsuter 3 as our best option as there is no competition (0 fitness centre), and also have a good amount of restaurants nearby. Cluster 3 consists of Sungai Lui and Batu 23 neighborhoods."
